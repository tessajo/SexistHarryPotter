# SexistHarryPotter

SexistHarryPotter is a research project, examining the contents of all seven Harry Potter books.
The project processes the data and extracts it from ebooks. The contents are then cleaned and preprocessed for further analysis.
The analysis consists of a statistical and a contentual part. In the statistical analysis, general data on the books is collected. In the contentual analysis ngrams and network graphs are used to examine whether female characters are being described differently than male characters in the books. To examine this, network analysis metrics are applied.
